# Pet_Defense
This is a prototype we created in DATT4300, a game development course.
In the game, the player are given varies types of pets to fight against invading ghosts.
Currently, we have 7 types of pets player can use and 4 types of ghost to fight against. 

It was originaly designed to run on mobile devices, but I made a web build of it:
